# N Queens
"N Queens" is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.


# Usage
- `Usage: nqueens <N>` where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
- The program prints every possible solution to the problem

## Examples
```sh
./0-nqueens.py 4
```
```output
[[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 0], [3, 2]]
[[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 3], [3, 1]]
```
```sh
./0-nqueens.py 6
```
```output
[[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 0], [4, 2], [5, 4]]
[[0, 2], [1, 5], [2, 1], [3, 4], [4, 0], [5, 3]]
[[0, 3], [1, 0], [2, 4], [3, 1], [4, 5], [5, 2]]
[[0, 4], [1, 2], [2, 0], [3, 5], [4, 3], [5, 1]]
```
